                            <h3>WIMPY</h3>
    <p>Our Story Starts...

            in 1967, two years before man first walked on the moon. This is when we opened our first restaurant in Murchies Passage, Durban and 1000 people visited the restaurant on opening day! Since then we’ve inspired families and friends to come together for shared moments over meals. What followed were many memorable moments.</p>

     <p>We take to the road…
     The 80’s. Prince Charles married Lady Diana and MTV and CNN are launched. We become the first sit-down restaurant to officially serve all South Africans. Yes, long before we became the Rainbow Nation, we were the Wimpy Family.</p>

     <p> Back then, we also partnered with Mobil (now Engen) and took to the road, making sure that a Wimpy pit-stop is a part of every journey.</p>

     <p>We learn to speak foreign…
        The 00’s. Internet is turning the world into a global village and we’re introduced to Facebook and social media.

       In the world of Wimpy, we are the first to introduce espresso-based coffees nationally through our Premium Blend Coffee Range, making catch-up coffee breaks a lot more special.
        And yes, we will always “love it when you talk foreign”.</p>

     <p>The story continues…
       Today we are a South African favourite and a leader in the quick table service, casual dining sector and have won numerous FASA and media awards along the way. Clearly nothing beats a Wimpy Moment!</p>
       <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
        <p>We are at shop 135 next to BANKING COURT</p>
